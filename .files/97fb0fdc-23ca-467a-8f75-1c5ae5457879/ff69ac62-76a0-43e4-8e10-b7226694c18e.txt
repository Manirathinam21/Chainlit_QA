In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the tournament.[55] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad, India.[56]
